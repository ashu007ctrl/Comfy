ARCHITECTURE
------------

Client-Server Architecture:
  - Frontend (Port 5173): React SPA served by Vite
  - Backend (Port 3000): Express.js REST API
  - Communication: JSON over HTTP (Axios)

Project Structure:
  /client
    /src
      /assets - Images and static files
      /components - Reusable UI components
      /data - Question data
      /pages - Page-level components
      App.jsx - Main application logic
      index.css - Global styles
  
  /server
    server.js - Express server + Gemini AI integration
    .env - Environment variables (API keys)


API ENDPOINTS
-------------
